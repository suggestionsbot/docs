### Coming Soon
As you can notice, the documentation looks different and smaller. This is because we have a new version of the bot running that is more minimal and gives you all the core functions to be able to run suggestions in your server.

However, this is not permanent and this is only the beginning of the next version of the bot. We all needed this version of the bot to allow the developers to focus on the future of the bot so we can provide the most powerful suggestion feature set we have on Discord.

This may not look much right now, but you will be able to see the full functionality of the bot in the future.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact us over on [Discord](https://suggestions.bot/discord)!
