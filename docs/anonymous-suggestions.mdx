As a community owner, there are times when you want to allow your community to give feedback but do so in an anonymous fashion. We now allow server owners and admins to harness that power by enabling anonymous suggestions in their servers.

Once enabled, users can optionally mark their suggestions as anonymous, omitting their profile information from being seen by everyone, including server owners and admins.

Learn below how you can utilize this feature in your server today!

## Getting Started

To start allowing the submission of anonymous suggestions, enable the feature with the `/config anonymous enable` command. The feature is disabled by default.

<SuggestionSlashReply command="/config anonymous enable" message="I have enabled anonymous suggestions for this guild." />

## Usage

Once enabled, all the user has to when submitting their suggestion is set the `anonymously` option to `true`.

```
/config suggest:Bring out Wumpus to meet the fans! anonymously:True
```

The suggestion is submitted normally. However, any identifying information such as the profile icon and user ID is removed from the suggestion.

<SuggestionEmbedMessage
  embed={<PendingSuggestion anonymousAuthor />}
  message={{
    buttons: true
  }}
  anonymousAuthor
/>

## Managing Suggestions

When approving or rejecting suggestions, everything is the same as explained over in the [Managing Suggestions](/managing-suggestions.mdx) section. However, once again, the user's profile information is omitted from the suggestion.

<SuggestionEmbedMessage
  embed={<SuggestionStatusEmbed status="approved" anonymousAuthor />}
  anonymousAuthor
/>

## Anonymous Resolutions
Anonymity is an integral part of many communities here on Discord; it's why we've also extended the anonymity of suggestions to the resolution process.

By enabling anonymous resolutions, you protect your staff member's identities when approving and rejecting suggestions.

To utilize this feature today, run `/config anonymous_resolutions enable`.

<SuggestionSlashReply command="/config anonymous_resolutions enable" message="All further suggestions will not show the moderator who resolved them." />

With it enabled, the process runs similarly to everything above. In this case, the moderator who resolved the suggestion is automatically marked anonymous upon resolution. Not only does this apply to the suggestion message itself, but the DM sent to the author as well.

<SuggestionEmbedMessage
  embed={<SuggestionStatusEmbed status="rejected" anonymousModerator anonymousAuthor response />}
/>
The above example has both the author and moderator anonymous.
<br/> <br/>

<SuggestionEmbedMessage
  embed={<SuggestionConfirmation status="rejected" anonymousModerator />}
/>
The above example has the moderator who rejected the suggestion removed from the DM sent to the submitter.
<br/> <br/>

<SuggestionEmbedMessage
  embed={<SuggestionConfirmation status="rejected" anonymousModerator response />}
/>
It also works when the moderator responds.

## More Information

As the actual submitter of the suggestion remains anonymous, the voters are not anonymous. Currently, the feature is mainly designed for the suggestion submitter itself.

For moderation reasons, we still log information such as the user ID of the submitted suggestion. This helps us combat any reported abuse with the bot and to continue our efforts in collecting statistics (more in our [Privacy Policy](https://suggestions.gg/privacy)).

If you have any questions regarding abuse or privacy, you may [email us](mailto:hello@suggestions.gg) or contact a developer in the [Discord](https://suggestions.bot/discord).
